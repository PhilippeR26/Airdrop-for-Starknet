# TUTORIAL
# Create your own airdrop
This tutorial assumes that you have a good understanding of React, the Next.js framework, the Starknet network and Starknet.js.

## Architecture :
The creation of an airdrop is splitted in several activities :
1. Create the Merkle tree  
A node.js script is used to generate the Merkle tree.  
A server is necessary to store this tree.  
A smart-contract is also necessary to store the root of the tree.
2. Create the DAPP  
The DAPP is mostly in the frontend, but some code is also necessary in the server. Here, the Next.js framework is chosen, because it can handle easily both the frontend and the server code.
3. Create the necessary smart-contracts  
Some smart-contracts are necessary to secure and perform the airdrop.

## Smart-contracts :
In term of smart-contracts, several contracts are necessary :
- an ERC20 or ERC721 contract, that handles the tokens/NFTs that will be claimed by the users.
- a contract that stores the root of the merkle tree, and perform the Merkle verification.
- a contract that will hold all the logical of the airdrop, store the list of addresses already airdropped, and manage the administration of the airdrop. It will be called by the DAPP, and it will call the 2 previous contracts.

# 1. Creation/storage of the merkle tree and the smart-contracts :
A Merkle tree is very useful for an airdrop : you will store very few data in the blockchain, you will ask few calculation to Starknet, and the frontend needs nearly zero resources. We need just some storage space in the server.

## creation of the Merkle tree :

Most of the time, you start your airdrop project with an Excel file including all the inputs : [data sheet example](./listAirdrop/). In this example, we have about 1400 whitelisted addresses, with a specific quantity of token affected to each one.

You have to transform these data into a json file. I made it with the find/replace capabilities of vsCode. The result is a `list` array. It includes small arrays containing :
- address
- quantity u256.low
- quantity u256.high
  
These arrays are called the **leaves** of the Merkle tree.  
I added 3 of my personal accounts, to be able to perform some tests.  
The result is [here]( scripts/listAddressesSepolia.json) .

Several TS codes will now be used, using the Starknet Sepolia Testnet.  
> All these scripts can be read [here](./scripts), and you can run them directly in my tuto repo [here](https://github.com/PhilippeR26/starknet.js-workshop-typescript/tree/main/src/scripts/merkleTree/airdropSJS6Sepolia).

The first script is using the [starknet-merkle-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/starknet-merkle-tree) library.
The tree can be hashed with Pedersen or Poseidon algorithms 
```typescript
import * as Merkle from "starknet-merkle-tree";

const list = json.parse(fs.readFileSync("./src/scripts/merkleTree/airdropSJS6Sepolia/listAddressesSepolia.json").toString("ascii"));
const airdrop: Merkle.InputForMerkle[] = list.list;
const tree1 = Merkle.StarknetMerkleTree.create(airdrop, Merkle.HashType.Poseidon);
console.log("root =", tree1.root); // for smartcontract constructor
fs.writeFileSync('./src/scripts/merkleTree/airdropSJS6Sepolia/treeListAddressSepolia.json', JSON.stringify(tree1.dump(),undefined,2));
```
After some seconds of hard calculation (50 minutes on my laptop for 500 000 leaves, 5 seconds for this tuto), the tree is completed and is stored in the hard disk. This calculation is needed only once ; from now, we will only read the tree file.

## storage of the Merkle tree file :
This big file has to be stored somewhere in the server, and it will be used only by the server (as it's a large file, it has to never be downloaded by the frontend).  
In this DAPP, the resulting tree is  stored in the server [here](src/app/server/tree/treeListAddressSepolia.json).

## Deployment of the Merkle-Verify contract :
As we have now the root value of the tree, we can deploy in Testnet an instance of the contract that verify the validity of a leaf.
We have the class hash for the poseidon version in the doc of starknet-merkle-tree [here](https://github.com/PhilippeR26/starknetMerkleTree#-verify-a-proof-in-the-starknet-blockchain-).  
This class is already declared in all networks. We have just to deploy it with a constructor including the root of the tree :
```typescript
const MERKLE_CLASS_HASH_POSEIDON = "0x03e2efc98f902c0b33eee6c3daa97b941912bcab61b6162884380c682e594eaf";
//    ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ change here with the result of script 1
const root = "0x194e675741d7c524534b48d1813ae10d036f4fb2f4e6077d1809fbb9d6d79f4"
const myConstructorMerkleVerify: Calldata = CallData.compile([root]);
console.log("In progress...");
const deployResponse = await account0.deployContract({
    //         ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ change here to PEDERSEN or POSEIDON
    classHash: MERKLE_CLASS_HASH_POSEIDON,
    constructorCalldata: myConstructorMerkleVerify
});
const MerkleVerifyAddress = deployResponse.contract_address;
console.log("MerkleVerify contract :");
console.log("address =", MerkleVerifyAddress);
```

## Declare/deploy the ERC20 token of the airdrop :
You can find in script 3 the details for the deployment of the SJS6 ERC20 token.

## Declare/deploy the airdrop management contract :
In this example, there is an airdrop for a whitelist, and a limited quantity of tokens sent as consolation prize for the fastest other users. All this logical is coded in the airdrop management contract.  
The Cairo code created for this tuto is [here]( scripts/airdropSJS6.cairo). You have to adapt it to your specific case.  
Deployment :
```typescript
const myCallAirdrop = new CallData(compiledSierraAirdrop.abi);
    const myConstructorAirdrop: Calldata = myCallAirdrop.compile("constructor", {
        erc20_address: ERC20_ADDRESS,
        merkle_address: MERKLE_VERIF_ADDRESS,
        erc20_owner: account0.address,
        start_time: 0, // no date of airdrop start
        consolation_remaining: 10_000,
    });
    const deployResponse = await account0.declareAndDeploy({
        contract: compiledSierraAirdrop,
        casm: compiledCasmAirdrop,
        constructorCalldata: myConstructorAirdrop
    });

    const airdropAddress = deployResponse.deploy.contract_address;
    const airdropClassHash = deployResponse.declare.class_hash;
    console.log("Airdrop contract :");
    console.log("class_hash =", airdropClassHash);
    console.log("address =", airdropAddress);
```
Script 4 is also authorizing the airdrop contract to spent the tokens of the ERC20 contract.

In this chapter, we have created the Merkle tree, and all the necessary contracts. Let see now inside the DAPP.

# 2. Handling of the airdrop in the DAPP :
In the DAPP, all the specific constants necessary for the airdrop are in `utils/constants`, [here](src/app/utils/constants.ts).

You have some main Components :
- `Block`, with its Zustand context. The last block number is read each 10 seconds. Each time the block number is changing, many updates are triggered in the DAPP (with useEffect()).
 
- `SelectWallet` will scan the `window` object of your browser, find all the Starknet wallet extensions, and check which wallets are compatible with Starknet.js v6 (so compatible with get-starknet v4.0.0). A wallet list is displayed and you have to select the one you want to use.
- `ConnectWallet`, with its context. It contains the code to connect a browser wallet account to your DAPP. It will create a Starknet.js v6 `WalletAccount` instance. You will use it for all your communications with Starknet. But under the hood, the browser wallet will be used for all actions that will request to write in Starknet, and your own rpcProvider (here a Blast provider) will be used to read the network. 
- `GetBalanceAirdrop`, is able to display the balance of the token. It updates the balance just after the airdrop transaction.
- `Airdrop` and `Claim`, that holds the complex logical of all possible cases of this airdrop. We interact with Starknet using the new WalletAccount class. To read Starknet, this class is using your own rpcProvider (here a Blast node). To write Starknet, it uses a direct link with the wallet. 
 
The Merkle tree data are asked to the server, using a [Next.js Server Action](src/app/server/airdropServer.ts) ; this function calls the [starknet-merkle-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/starknet-merkle-tree) library to get the proof corresponding to the account address.

# 3. Execution of the airdrop in Starknet :
The DAPP is interacting with Starknet for :
- Read the ERC20contract :
  ```typescript
  const resp = await erc20Contract.call("balanceOf", [accountAddress]) as bigint;
  ```
- Read the last block :
  ```typescript
  const block = await FrontendProvider..getBlockNumber();
  ```
- Read the quantity of remaining tokens for the consolation prizes :
  ```typescript
  const qty_consolation_remaining = await airdropContract.call("remaining_consolation") as bigint;
  ```
- Read the quantity of tokens already airdropped :
  ```typescript
  const qty_airdrop = await airdropContract.call("qty_airdropped") as bigint;
  ```
- Check if an address is already airdropped :
  ```typescript
  const isAirdropped = await airdropContract.call("is_address_airdropped", [addressAccountFromContext]) as boolean;
  ```
- Check if an address has already received a consolation prize :
  ```typescript
  const isConsol = await airdropContract.call("is_address_consoled",[addressAccountFromContext]) as boolean;
  ```
- Execute the airdrop :
  ```typescript
  const myWalletAccount = new WalletAccount(new RpcProvider({ nodeUrl: myProviderUrl }), myWallet);
  const claimCall = airdropContract.populate("claim_airdrop", {
      amount: amount,
      proof: proof,
    })
  const resp = await myWalletAccount?.execute(claimCall);
  const txR = await myProvider.waitForTransaction(resp.transaction_hash);
  ```

In the Airdrop contract, 2 mappings are managed :
- one for the airdrops already performed.
- one for the addresses that have already received a consolation prize.

When you invoke the `claim_airdrop` function, some checks are performed :
- The address is not yet airdropped.
- The airdrop is active.
- If the Merkle proof is valid, and if no consolation prize has been already performed for this address (a case that should not occur in the DAPP ; only from malicious actors), the airdrop is performed.
